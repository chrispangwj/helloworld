HR tutorial and handbook 
Hello! I am a new HR intern. 
I would like to help document the HR processes and tasks I am learning in an organized way to leave behind a guide that future practitioners can use systematically or as a new HR need arises. 
I would like to explore Github as a repository and medium for sharing HR knowledge.
